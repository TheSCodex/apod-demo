# APOD Demo

This repository contains a small, interactive demo that showcases the capabilities of the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. The demo is built with Vite and React, and it allows users to input a date and view the corresponding astronomy picture of the day, along with a detailed explanation. This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate external APIs into a modern JavaScript application.
